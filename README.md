# Advent of Code 2020
My puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2020. Nothing fancy this time, I am simply focussing on solving the puzzles as quickly as I can in C++ (using dirty tricks such as `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` ðŸ˜¬). Might do some clean-up afterwards, but do not expect anything exemplary here.

## Build & Run
Most of my solutions will be standalone C++ programs with no external dependencies (other than the STL). Compiling should be as simple as
```
$ g++ main.cc
```

My solutions assume that the input can be read from `stdin`. I am running them like this:
```
$ ./a.out <input.txt
```
