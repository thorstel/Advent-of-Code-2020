# Advent-of-Code-2020
My puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2020. This time, I am focussing on solving the puzzles as quickly as I can. Might do some clean-up afterwards, but do not expect anything exemplary here.

I am not committing myself to a single programming language this year, but most days I will probably just use my "dirty" C++ template with `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` ðŸ˜¬

All my solutions will assume that the input can be read from `stdin`.
